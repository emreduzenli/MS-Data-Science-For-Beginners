# Assignment: Data Science Scenarios

In this first assignment, we ask you to think about some real-life process or problem in different problem domains, and how you can improve it using the Data Science process. Think about the following:

1. Which data can you collect?
1. How would you collect it?
1. How would you store the data? How large the data is likely to be?
1. Which insights you might be able to get from this data? Which decisions we would be able to take based on the data?

Try to think about 3 different problems/processes and describe each of the points above for each problem domain.

Here are some of the problem domains and problems that can get you started thinking:

1. How can you use data to improve education process for children in schools?
1. How can you use data to control vaccination during the pandemic?
1. How can you use data to make sure you are being productive at work?
## Instructions

Fill in the following table (substitute suggested problem domains for your own ones if needed):

| Problem Domain | Problem | Which data to collect | How to store the data | Which insights/decisions we can make | 
|----------------|---------|-----------------------|-----------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Education | Education process in schools need to be improved | list of the students and their grades for each subject, survey students on what they think can be improved | each school would have their own SQL database for all students, or different databases for different year groups | the subjects which students are finding most difficult: from avg grades or survey, which subjects need to be simplified/improved: from avg grades, if students need extra revision/tutoring sessions: from survey|
| Vaccination | need to keep track of who has been vaccinated and who still needs to be vaccinated | list of people registered for healthcare/list of people in the country and where they live - and if they have been vaccinated or not, or if they are eligible or ineligible for vaccinations | SQL database of their name, home address, any medical identifiers (e.g. NHS number), and vaccination status | the amount of population who have been vaccinated, areas which may need more vaccination availability, people who are ineligible for vaccinations to be aware of, how to handle vaccianations and spread them across the population efficiently |
| Productivity | productivity dips at certain times during work | how often you get distracted: e.g. how long you spend on social media apps during work hours, how your time is spent throughout the day - e.g. working, meetings, breaks etc. | SQL database of work day, activity (working, looking at phone etc.), and how much time was spent on it | see which times we are most likely to have a productivity dip, find out when to remove distractions to stay focussed for longer - find out when we need to take breaks to improve productivity |

## Rubric

Exemplary | Adequate | Needs Improvement
--- | --- | -- |
One was able to identify reasonable data sources, ways of storing data and possible decisions/insights for all problem domains | Some of the aspects of the solution are not detailed, data storage is not discussed, at least 2 problem domains are described | Only parts of the data solution are described, only one problem domain is considered.
