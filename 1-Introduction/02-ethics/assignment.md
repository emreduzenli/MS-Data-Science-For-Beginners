## Write A Data Ethics Case Study

## Instructions

You've learned about various [Data Ethics Challenges](README.md#2-ethics-challenges) and seen some examples of [Case Studies](README.md#3-case-studies) reflecting data ethics challenges in real-world contexts.

In this assignment, you'll write your own case study reflecting a data ethics challenge from your own experience, or from a relevant real-world context you are familiar with. Just follow these steps:

1. `Pick a Data Ethics Challenge`. Look at [the lesson examples](README.md#2-ethics-challenges) or explore online examples like [the Deon Checklist](https://deon.drivendata.org/examples/) to get inspiration.

2. `Describe a Real World Example`. Think about a situation you have heard of (headlines, research study etc.) or experienced (local community), where this specific challenge occurred. Think about the data ethics questions related to the challenge - and discuss the potential harms or unintended consequences that arise because of this issue. Bonus points: think about potential solutions or processes that may be applied here to help eliminate or mitigate the adverse impact of this challenge.

3. `Provide a Related Resources list`. Share one or more resources (links to an article, a personal blog post or image, online research paper etc.) to prove this was a real-world occurrence. Bonus points: share resources that also showcase the potential harms & consequences from the incident, or highlight positive steps taken to prevent its recurrence.


## Cambridge Analytica and Facebook:

In 2018, it was revealed that Cambridge Analytica, a political consulting firm, had improperly obtained and used personal data from millions of Facebook users without their explicit consent. The data was collected through a third-party app that used a Facebook login feature, and the app not only collected data from the users who installed it but also their Facebook friends' data, resulting in a massive dataset.

### Data Ownership Challenge:
The challenge in this case revolved around the ownership of the collected data. Facebook users who had shared their information on the platform might not have been fully aware that their data, along with their friends' data, was being harvested on such a large scale. The issue of data ownership became complex as users questioned whether they truly owned the data they had shared, and whether Facebook had adequately protected their rights and privacy.

### Informed Consent Challenge:
Another major concern was informed consent. When users agreed to the terms and conditions of the app that collected their data, they might not have been fully aware of the extent to which their data would be used, shared, and potentially exploited for political purposes. The lack of transparency in how the data would be used for targeted advertising and political campaigns raised ethical questions about whether users had given meaningful consent to such practices.

This incident led to a widespread debate about data privacy, user control, and the responsibility of companies to ensure that users are well-informed and have genuine agency over their personal data. It also prompted discussions about the need for stricter regulations to protect user data and hold companies accountable for breaches of trust.

As a result of the Cambridge Analytica scandal, there was increased awareness about the importance of clear data ownership and transparent informed consent in the digital age. It also triggered discussions about the need for comprehensive data protection laws, such as the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), to better safeguard user data and privacy rights.

--- | --- | -- |
One or more data ethics challenges are identified. <br/> <br/> The case study clearly describes a real-world incident reflecting that challenge, and highlights undesirable consequences or harms it caused. <br/><br/> There is at least one linked resource to prove this occurred. | One data ethics challenge is identified. <br/><br/> At least one relevant harm or consequence is discussed briefly. <br/><br/> However discussion is limited or lacks proof of real-world occurence. | A data challenge is identified. <br/><br/> However the description or resources do not adequately reflect the challenge or prove it's real-world occurence. |
